    "* Making method calls\n",
    "D-Bus applications can export objects for other applications' use. To start working with an object in another application, you need to know:\n",
    "- The bus name such as org.freedesktop.NetworkManager\n",
    "- The object path. Applications can export many objects - for instance. As you'd expect, one of the main things you can do with remote objects is to call their methods. As in Python, methods may have parameters, and they may return one or more values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connect to a system Dbus object and read values\n",
    "To interact with a remote object, you use a proxy object. This is a Python object which acts as a proxy or \"stand-in\" for the remote object - when you call a method on a proxy object, this causes dbus-python to make a method call on the remote object, passing back any return values from the remote object's method as the return values of the proxy method call.\n",
    "For example, NetworkManager has the well-known name org.freedesktop.NetworkManager and exports an object whose object path is /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager. \n",
